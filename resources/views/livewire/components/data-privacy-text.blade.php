                        not knowingly omitted any related information of an adverse nature.</p>
                    <p class="fs-4">For example, we may use the information we collect for purposes such as:</p>

                    <p class="fw-bold">How We Use, Store, and Retain Them</p>
                    <p class="fs-4">All information collected by domains maintained by NETI are stored in its data
                        center that is accessible only to authorized personnel and agents, such as, in some cases, third

                        the declared purpose for its collection. In no case is it shared with or transferred to other
                        persons or organizations, unless required or permitted by law.</p>
